# Image Database
> **Warning**
> The current state of this project is unstable/incomplete and is expected to have missing features and bugs. 
An image database which currently allows the user to upload images and view them on a web server. Made by Evan.

## Installation and Usage
Prerequisites: Web server (e.g. [Apache](https://www.apache.org/)), [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) (`^8.2.1`)

You can install the image database by cloning the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/2kbyte/image-database.git```
Then open the 'index.html' file. Without a webserver, the images will not load because there must be an HTTP request. Ensure that PHP has permissions to read/write to the 'images/' directory, otherwise the upload function will not work.
