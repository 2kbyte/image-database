# Image Database
> **Warning**
> This is a warning
An image database which currently allows the user to upload images and view them on a web server.

## Installation and Usage
Prerequisites: Web server (e.g. [Apache](https://www.apache.org/)), [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) (`^8.2.1`)

You can install the image database by cloning the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/2kbyte/image-database.git```

Then open the 'index.html' file. Ensure that PHP has permissions to read/write to the 'images/' directory, otherwise the upload function will not work.
